            Flughafen Templehof has so much history it would be a shame to miss
            out! Tempelhof Airport closed all operations on 30 October 2008, and
            is now a park for everyone to use and enjoy.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is perfect to ride around as the park is actually quite large.
            The disused runway is an experience that you wonâ€™t get very often.{" "}
            <br />
            <br />
            There is many entrances and some are close to the U-Bahn stations,
            there is bound to be some bikes to hire around the entrances.
