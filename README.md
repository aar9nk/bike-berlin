# Bike Laws in Berlin

https://bike-berlin.netlify.app/

**A project website using using React context to display the bike laws in Berlin**

The more advanced end of my react abilities allowed me to create a website which shows some difficult to find english translations of the bike laws.
Students who are interested can see load on scroll effects and using context in react!
